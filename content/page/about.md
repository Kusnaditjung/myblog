My name is Kusnadi. I used to teach in the computer science department, and now I am a software engineer. While software engineering is a great career, I did miss the teaching and engagement with students. I hope to rekindle my teaching memory and also my learning in my current career via this blog.


### Journey

I went to an Electrical Engineering school for my undergraduate and went straight for a teaching career for the next ten years in a computer science department. I have done a Master degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering in Melbourne, Australia during this period. In 2008 I went to the UK, and started my Ph.D. degree, and making the transition to living and working in the UK afterward as a software engineer.



### Technology Stacks
In my software engineering career, the technology I used was predominantly .NET stacks. I worked heavily on .NET backend API technology stacks. During my last year of employment, I transitioned to functional programming and distributed system Akka model, using languageExt and Echo C# library. In my current employment, I mostly use Java stacks with microservice architecture using DropWizard. Apart from this, I continually improved myself by self-learning in my own time using different technology stacks such as React, react-native, Typescript, and Django. Switching technology stacks is fun and great for learning.

### Domain expertise
I consider myself an expert in Healthcare Interoperability, particularly HL7 V3, CDA, and FHIR. I worked for more than 13 years within NHS technology spaces. Though I am not limiting myself, it is more likely I will continue in this space due to demand. However, I take a great interest in the software engineering challenges and marvel of the new technologies, so I will take the challenge if the opportunity arises.
